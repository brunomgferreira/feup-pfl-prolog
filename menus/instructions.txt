                            The name "Blinq" stems from the combination of "Binary" and "Link", 
                            capturing the essence of the game’s duality and its ultimate goal of connection.
                            Blinq is a fascinating strategy game for two players, each tasked with connecting 
                            their designated sides of the board.

                            Objective:
                                Players alternate turns placing dual-colored blocks on the board, working toward their goal:  
                                    White: Connect the left and right sides of the board.
                                    Black: Connect the top and bottom sides of the board.
                                
                            Gameplay:
                                The game begins with the neutral block placed in the board's center.

                                Starting with White, players alternate turns placing one of their
                                blocks on the board.

                                Blocks must be positioned within the grid or stacked atop a 2x2 platform on higher levels.
                                        
                                The path to victory lies in creating a continuous connection of one's color, visible from above.


                            In Blinq, each decision carries dual consequences, blurring the lines between offense and defense. 
                            The balance of building your path while disrupting your opponent’s is the heart of this captivating game of connection.                                        
                                                                    
                                                                    
                                                                    (Press enter to go back)
